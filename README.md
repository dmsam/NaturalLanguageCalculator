A text-based console application to perform simple natural language calculations which uses shunting yard algorithm
to perform operations. The supported input values are the whole numbers between zero and ten inclusive.Input values must be expressed as text, e.g. ‘one’, ‘five’, etc.Input values are not case-sensitive. Both ‘two and ‘TWO’ are equally valid.
Supported Arithmetic Operators and Operator Permitted Aliases are Add (+) add, plus ,Subtract (-) subtract, minus, less,Multiply (*) multiplied-by, times,Divide (/) divided-by, over.Aliases are not case-sensitive. Both ‘add’ and ‘ADD’ are equally valid.
Any number of operations may be chained together. When two or more operations are chained together, any multiply or divide operation
must take precedence over any add or subtract operation, similar to how a real calculator works.
